# Deployment of Honeypot in Azure's cloud utilizing T-pot


# Steps Taken to implement this project. 

## 1.  Create resource group. Once the Azure account has been created and the subscription is set up, I started by creating a resource group. This is basically a folder/container where all the resources for this lab reside, for example, the virtual network, the VM, and other components. 

- From the dashboard, click on resource groups, give it a name, and click on review and create

## Step 2 Create the virtual network. Here I created the virtual network.

- The virtual network is basically, our network structure to which the VM running the honeypot will use to connect to the internet.
  
- From the Azure dashboard or in the search bar find and select Virtual networks
- Then name the virtual network. The IP address space can be left as default.
- Then click review and create > Create.

## Step 3: Create the virtual machine. In this step I created the VM that will run the Honey pot. 

- This VM will be running Ubuntu
